## Binomial Trees
The binomial tree $$ B_k $$ is an ordered tree defined recursively.
- Binomial tree $$ B_0 $$ consists of a single node.
- The binomial tree $$ B_k $$ consists of two binomial trees $$B_{k-1} $$ that are linked together: the root of one is the leftmost child of the root of the other.

#### Some properties of binomial tree
For the binomial tree $$ B_k $$,

1. There are $$ 2^k $$ nodes
2. The height of the tree is $$ k $$
3. There are exactly $$ \binom{N}{k} $$ nodes at depth $$ i $$ for $$ i = 0, 1, ..., k $$
4. The root has degree $$ k $$, where $$ k > $$ the degree of any other node.

## Binomial Heaps
A binomial heap $$ H $$ is a forest of binomial trees that satisfies the following ***binomial-heap properties.***

1. Each binomial tree obeys the *min-heap property*  
**Min-heap property:** The key of node $$>=$$ the key of its parent.  
Each such tree is called *min-heap ordered*.
2. For any k $$ (k >= 0) $$, there is at most one binomial tree whose root has degree $$k$$.

Binomial tress in the binomial heap is ***sorted by ascending number of children***.

## Relaxed Binomial Tree
A relaxed binomial tree $$ U_k $$ of order $$k$$ consists of a root with $$k$$ children, $$j$$-th $$(j=1...k)$$ of which is a relaxed binomial tree of order $$k' \ge j-2$$.
