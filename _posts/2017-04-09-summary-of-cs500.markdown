## Binomial Trees
The binomial tree $$ B_k $$ is an ordered tree defined recursively.
- Binomial tree or order 0 $$ B_0 $$ consists of a single node.
- The binomial tree $$ B_k $$ consists of two binomial trees $$B_{k-1} $$ that are linked together: the root of one is the leftmost child of the root of the other.
- A binomial tree of order $$ k $$ has a root node whose children are roots of binomial trees of orders $$ k-1, k-2, ..., 2, 1, 0 $$ (in this order).

order
: The order of a binomial tree $$ B_k $$ is $$ k $$.  
A binomial tree of order $$ k$$ has $$ 2^k $$ nodes, and height $$ k $$.

#### Some properties of binomial tree
For the binomial tree $$ B_k $$,

1. There are $$ 2^k $$ nodes
2. The height of the tree is $$ k $$
3. There are exactly $$ \binom{N}{k} $$ nodes at depth $$ i $$ for $$ i = 0, 1, ..., k $$
4. The root has degree $$ k $$, where $$ k > $$ the degree of any other node.

## Binomial Heaps
A binomial heap $$ H $$ is a forest of binomial trees that satisfies the following ***binomial-heap properties.***

1. Each binomial tree obeys the *min-heap property*  
**Min-heap property:** The key of node $$>=$$ the key of its parent.  
Each such tree is called *min-heap ordered*.
2. For any k $$ (k >= 0) $$, there is at most one binomial tree whose root has degree $$k$$.

Binomial tress in the binomial heap are ***sorted by ascending number of children***.

#### Operations of binomial Heaps
1. Creating a new binomial heap ($$ \Theta(1) $$)
2. Finding the minimum node ($$ \Theta(lg_{}n) $$)
3. Merging two binomial heaps ($$ O(lg_{}n) $$)
4. Inserting a node ($$ \Theta(1) $$)
5. Extracting the minimum node ($$ \Theta(lg_{}n) $$)

## Relaxed Binomial Tree
Remember that the definition of a binomial tree is

> A binomial tree of order $$ k $$ has a root node whose children are roots of binomial trees of orders $$ k-1, k-2, ..., 2, 1, 0 $$ (in this order).

A relaxed binomial tree $$ U_k $$ of order $$k$$ consists of a root with $$k$$ children, $$j$$-th $$(j=1...k)$$ of which is a relaxed binomial tree of order $$k' \ge j-2$$.

## Unordered Binomial Trees
The textbook does not use the definition of relaxed binomial tree, but explains an *unordered binomial tree*.

An unordered binomial tree is like a binomial tree, and it is defined recursively, too.  

- The unordered binomial tree $$ U_0 $$ consists of a single node.
- An unorrdered binomial tree $$ U_k $$ consists of two unordered binomial trees $$ U_{k-1} $$ for which the root of one is made into *any* child of the root of the other.

## Fibonacci Heaps
There are two definitions, one from the course slide, and the other from the textbook.
- A Fibonacci heap $$ H $$ is a list of $$ t $$ heap-ordered relaxed binomial trees with a pointer to the root whose key is the minimum. (slide)
- A Fibonacci heap $$ H $$ is a collection of min-heap-ordered trees. The trees in a Fibonacci heap are not constrained to be binomial trees, however. (textbook)

> Both are same, because consolidating trees actually makes a relaxed binomial tree.
