After unexpectedly erasing all data in my previous blog, I did not make another blog for a long time.  
Now I restarted a blog, now with Jekyll and Github Pages.

Comparing Wordpress, it has following advantages:
- The format of posts, Markdown, is easy to edit in anywhere. I need to accustom markup languages, e.g., LaTex or Markdown.
- Use Git system. chance to be more familiar with Git?
- Not as many plugins as in Wordpress, but all the necessary are provided and fast!
- **No need to run any server on my local machine.**
- **No need to buy a domain name :)**
- **Write a post in offline mode. Can upload a post later.**

Hope to post my research topics in the future.
